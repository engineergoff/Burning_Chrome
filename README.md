Burning_Chrome (Project for the Creation of Custom Shortcuts in Chrome)
==============

This is a project to create a simple template for turning websites into web apps on Google Chrome.  This project is based on the tutorial written by Kenneth Butler of blog.laptopmag.com.  This tutorial was published on May 7, 2013.  It was entitled "How to Add Custom Shortcuts to Your Chromebook App Launcher."   

Version 1.0 of this project will be a simple validation of Mr. Butler's method. 

A template file set will be created.  This is the file set you should download when independently verifying this method.   A secondary file set will be created as a proof of concept should Mr. Butlers method proved adequate.  It is my intention to provide a detailed tutorial/guide for the layman or those who are not familiar with programming, and to give the novice the tools and instructions that they need to be able to do this themselves.

Should Version 1.0 of this project prove fruitful, I intend to create a refined method I will call Version 1.1.  

My goal with this will be more ambitious and will involve applications of Google's new technologies for creating packaged apps.
